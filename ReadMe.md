# HBOX IoT Cloud Data Sharing Readme

This Guide has been written to aid in the setup of HNC HBOX equipment to write and read variables through the Cloud Data Center. The author is not an expert on these devices and has forged through the available documentation and help to achieve the task. I cannot comment on the security of IoT Cloud other than to say the communication and pairing of devices seems to have reasonable levels of security.
